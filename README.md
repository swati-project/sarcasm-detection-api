# Exploring Machine Learning Models for Sarcasm Detection on Twitter 🤖

In a world heavily shaped by social media platforms such as Twitter, sarcasm detection is an indispensable challenge. Sarcasm, often concealed within subtle linguistic cues, not only has an impact on sentiment analysis but also plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion.

This project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of different models used for sarcasm detection. It examines three distinct paradigms: Random Forest(bagging), XG boost(boosting), and LSTM-based transformers. This study begins with the collection and preprocessing of a diverse dataset on Twitter sarcasm encompassing various linguistic styles and sarcastic expressions. Through meticulous evaluation, the potency of each model is examined.
